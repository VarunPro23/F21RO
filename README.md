# F21RO

This repo contains files for the coursework assigned for the course F21RO.

This coursework aims to use robot simulators and software tools to create intelligent controllers for robots using advanced bio-inspired techniques. It involves using a well-known robot simulator, creating specific environment configurations and applying bio-inspired algorithms to create intelligent controllers for robots, analysing the resultant robot behaviours and drawing conclusions from it.
